# Chess Knight Travails Problem

this is a small Project to show an possible solution to the Knight Travails Problem in Chess.

The Main function takes two Arrays (start coordinates, end coordinates), e.g.:

```
findPath([0, 0],[ 3, 3]);
```

and returns the an Array with the taken Path form start to end e.g. [0,0, 1,2, 3,3].

The Algorithm takes a BFS abroach to search for the right path.
